This directory contains a `registry.jsonl` file which is a datafile containing summaries of trained models, and their unique ID, in a new-line json format. There are also the model pickel files named as thier unique ID.

If this were a real project I would implement this model saving on a cloud service such as Google Cloud Storage, and the registry as a database table i.e. Google BigQuery or MongoDB.
