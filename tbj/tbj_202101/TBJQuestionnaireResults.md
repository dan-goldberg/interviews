## Question 1: Which shortstop converted the most outs above average?

The leader in Outs Above Average (OAA) in this dataset was playerid 162066 with 11.09 outs above average. I used a fully Bayesian model (Multilevel Logistic Regression) so the leaderboard below has OAA_mean (the estimate of OAA) and OAA_std (the estimate of uncertainty) instead of just OAA. I've also added OAA_per_Opp to give a rate stat next to the counting stat.

### 1 - Methodology

To estimate the OAA metric I decided to follow the lead of [Tom Tango and the Statcast team](https://www.mlb.com/news/statcast-introduces-outs-above-average-for-infield-defense) and train a probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of an average shortstop making an out on a given play. As they explain, using this probability (i.e. 70%) we can then take the observed outcome as a binary variable (0 or 1) and interpret the shortstop of converting that original probability into either 0% (failure) or 100% (success). For example if the shortstop makes the play they would be adding the difference for that particular observation (100% - 70% = 30%) and get that amount of credit (i.e. 0.3 outs above average). 

So the plan was to train a probabilistic model to learn some function from a multivariate input (some features of a given play) to a probability of an average shortstop making an out. To do this I wanted to experiment with different kinds of model families, and different hyperparameter configurations within model families. The space of potential models would be those which could output some probability with respect to a binary outcome, and so each potential model could be optimized against a log-loss objective. 

It being my strongest programming language and having a rich statistical ecosystem second only to R, I programmed in python, mostly leveraging scikit-learn. 

#### 1.1 - The Dataset

In exploring and preprocessing the dataset I had two goals in mind. 

The first goal was to find an appropriate subset of all groundballs that the shortstop should be evaluated on. For example, when the shortstop is on the 3B side of the infield, a groundball to 1B really has nothing to do with the SS (in most cases) and so the SS should not get any credit or blame for an out being or not being made. The SS should only be evaluated on plays the could have potentially had some impact on. I decided as a starting point to filter out any plays that were made by another infielder (i.e. the 3B cuts in front of the SS and then makes the out at first) or any plays that were not turned into outs. This would still include some plays that were completely out of the SS's reach, though I address this in the design of input features for the model.

The second goal was to turn the raw dataset into input features that would describe the difficulty of the groundball (from the SS perspective) in such a way that was agnostic to where the SS was initially positioned. Doing so would require capturing the relative positions of the batted ball and the shortstop no matter where the SS stood. As it turns out, the starting position for a SS varies quite a bit, as seen in this plot of the SS starting position on 10k random groundballs.

<img src="assets/10kStartingPositions.png" width="400" alt="10k Starting Positions">

I decided that there is a lot of information about the difficulty of the play in the batted ball trajectory. From both [Fangraphs](https://library.fangraphs.com/defensive-runs-saved-2020-update/) and [Statcast](https://www.mlb.com/news/statcast-introduces-outs-above-average-for-infield-defense), OAA decomposes a defensive play into the following components of a play: positioning, range, fielding, and throwing, with positioning being a component that the team gets credit for rather than the player. By utilizing the batted ball trajectory I thought I could create some features that captured aspects of range, fielding, and throwing, though certainly imperfectly. The following were some intermediate features I designed using this data:
- The orthogonal projection from the player position vector to the span of the launch trajectory. This gives the absolutely smallest distance the player would have to move to get in the ball's path (albeit possibly after the ball has passed that point).
- The inferred interception point, if it exists - the point that minimizes the player's time to the ball's path. This assumes the player moves at 21 ft/s, which is less than the ~25ft/s many players can sprint at, according to Statcast (though still a gross simplification). I used calculations outlined in the [Appendix](#appendix) to solve this minimization equation. 
- The assumed "base of interest" for the player, depending on the runners on base and whether they are in motion or not. This is a prerequisite for the next feature.
- The angle to the base of interest at either the inferred interception point, or the orthogonal projection point if that doesn't exist. This is intended to capture an aspect of the player's momentum towards or away from the base the will throw to.
- The time it takes to get to the intersection point (or orthogonal projection point), where the hypothesis is that less time is better, and gives the defender more time to complete the play. 
- The difference between the ball's time to the interception point and the SS's time to the interception point. If the ball takes much less time to reach that interception point then it is very unlikely the SS can actually field the ball - this should be quite a reliable indication of whether the play is well outside the fielder's range or not.

I created a visualization tool while exploring the dataset and developing these features which makes these descriptions a bit clearer. The following are some examples of groundball observations from the dataset, which are considered evaluation datapoints for the SS:

<img src="assets/VizExample001.png" width="400" alt="Example 1" style="vertical-align:middle">

In this example you can see the player's starting position as the blue dot, and the span of the ball's launch trajectory as the blue line. The orange dot is where the ball landed, and the red dot is where the player could intercept the ball to minimize time to the ball - in this case since the player is already on the ball's trajectory it would just mean charging the ball. The green dot is indicating that 2B is the base of interest in this case, meaning there's a runner on 1B and a force play at 2B (plus the runner is not in motion).

<img src="assets/VizExample006.png" width="400" alt="Example 2" style="vertical-align:middle">

In the second example you can see a similar situation, except now the ball's trajectory is to the player's left. There is still a red dot indicating there is an inferred interception point. However in this example it is easier to see the orange line, which is the shortest path to the ball's trajectory span, orthogonal to the trajectory. The "angle to the base of interest" feature captures the angle between the green, blue, and red dots, with the blue (player position) as the vertex. In this case the angle is very acute (close to 0) and the player's momentum will be carrying him towards the base as he intercepts the ball at the red dot. 

<img src="assets/VizExample007.png" width="400" alt="Example 6">

This example illustrates a tough play in the hole, where the angle is > 90 degrees to 1B. 

<img src="assets/VizExample003.png" width="400" alt="Example 3">
<img src="assets/VizExample004.png" width="400" alt="Example 4">
<img src="assets/VizExample005.png" width="400" alt="Example 5">

Here are more examples, some of which have no red dot, meaning given the player speed assumption the player cannot intercept the ball at all. There are times when a player does intercept the ball despite this calculation not giving an inferred interception point, though this means the SS has likely made a very tough, high-range play. 

All features were standard-scaled before being fed into each model, since some models (like Support Vector Machines) assumed scaled features. I started out also applying a log transform before scaling two of the features, but never progressed to experimenting with different feature scalings. With more time I would've run experiments on scaling and also on withholding certain features; one of my worries about the design matrix I used was high correllation between inputs, which might cause more difficult training for some of the models. Given the time constrains, though, I moved on with what I thought was a solid design matrix. 


#### 1.2 - Candidate Models

The most important prerequisite of this modelling exersize was to train a model to output probabilities. A simple classification or even confidence score would not suffice. For this reason there were three classes of models I initially considered:

1. Generalized linear or non-linear models with inverse logit output (Standard Logistic Regression, Logistic GAM, Logistic Multilevel Regression, Neural Network w/Sigmoid Output)

    These models can be trained on a log-loss (a.k.a. binary cross-entropy) objective which would likely calibrate their probability predictions very nicely (though less-so for neural networks). My guess was that these models would do a better job with calibrated probabilities, but I was also concerned that for the linear models they wouldn't be able to learn how to handle any complex non-linear interactions between features that might exist. Still, the closer I can get my features to reflect the true causal graph, the better a linear model might perform. GAMs are very flexible and was my guess for the best option out of this family, though they are quite manual (I think) and I am not very experienced with GAMs. They would require even more feature engineering to decide on kinds of basis functions applied. 

2. Ensemble of non-probabilistic classification models for bootstrapped probability score (i.e. Random Forest Decision Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees)

    Ensemble models 

3. Other generative models (i.e. Naive Bayes, Mixture of Gaussians, Gaussian Process)

    I thought learning multivariate generative model like a Gaussian Process would been a good candidate since it's so flexible, and would possibly learn a well-calibrated probability, though these models are usually more time-expensive to train. 

#### 1.3 - Training Method

For non-Bayesian Models (no priors):

- k-fold Cross Validation for evaluating the log-loss objective (inner loop)
- Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning (outer loop)

For Logistic GAM:



For Fully Bayesian Models (w/ priors on parameters):

- Using Stan to define model and NUTS optimizer. 
- Carefully select priors by first simulating in output space (* I didn't do this proper workflow due to time constraints).

#### 1.4 - Model Evaluation & Selection

- Want out-of-sample Log-Loss, regardless of whether the model was Bayesian or non-Bayesian

### 2 - Code

My programming efforts focused on creating functionality to make useful visualizations of the data, a generic pipeline for training models, and a way to save models for evaluation and model selection. I also wanted to showcase how I would build experiment code for production.

#### 2.1 - ModelExperiment (utils.ml_training)

Implements the training scheme for non-Bayesian models, including the inner loop k-fold cross validation, outer loop bayesian optimization, and model saving. 

#### 2.2 - ModelPersistance (utils.ml_utils)

Saves models trained in baysian optimization experiment so it's easy to load the exact model, along with meta-data of the model like parameter settings and the value of objective funciton at those settings. This makes it easy to check on the results of an experiment and load the best model to re-train and deploy. 

#### 2.3 - Diamond (utils.viz_utils)

Built as part of exporing the dataset, this class provides a convenient way to plot coordinates on a to-scale diagram of a generic baseball diamond, along with line segments for ball trajectory and player trajectory. 

## Question 2: In addition to whatâ€™s included in the provided dataset, what variables or types of information do you think would be helpful in answering this question more effectively? 

- Number of outs at the time of play - impossible to model doubleplays without this (need to know if doubleplay is even possible, or if there's two outs).
- Actual position of interception - would help break up components of range, field, and throw. Would also be an important step for modelling probability of doubleplay.
- The handedness of the batter and the speed of the batter - to estimate the batters time to first base.
- The speed of the baserunners - to estimate the time to their destination base.
- The handedness of the pitcher, maybe.
- Accurate spin readings, plus 3D spin, not just 2D spin. 
- The ballpark - they might have different hop profiles for groundballs due to different materials (i.e. turf), groundskeeping, design of infield.

## Question 3: Other than the final leaderboard, what is one interesting or surprising finding you made? 

While exploring the shortstop defense dataset I became interested in the launch spin and launch axis measurements. These columns contain much missing data, and I thought that they might be useful for modelling the probability of the shortstop making an out - my hypothesis was that a groundball with top spin or side spin might behave much more eradically than a ball starting with backspin, and that more spin might make some plays like charging plays more difficult. I thought that I would try to impute the missing values in some way to try to utilize the useful information that the non-missing values might have for modelling out probability. To do this I created a model of spin using a few features I thought would be causally related to spin - launch speed and launch angle. 


## Appendix

### 1 - Inferred Interception Point

Many important starting-point-agnostic features I built relied on having a particular point where the player might intercept the ball. To approximate where the player might intercept the ball (if possible) I used the following variables:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$s_{player} \rightarrow \textrm{speed of player (ft/s)}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$s_{ball} \rightarrow \textrm{speed of ball (ft/s)}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\bold{p} \rightarrow \textrm{starting position of player}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\bold{b} \rightarrow \textrm{position of ball at interception (also the position of the player at interception)}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$time_{player} \rightarrow \textrm{time for player to move from starting position to interception position}$  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$time_{player} \rightarrow \textrm{time for ball to move from launch position to interception position}$  

We are trying to solve the equation
$$time_{player}=time_{ball}$$ 
for unknown $\bold{b} $ if a real root exists. If no real root exists then the player cannot intercept the ball. For this derivation we will make the simplification that the player speed, $s_{player}$, and ball speed, $s_{ball}$, are constant. We know this is incorrect because the player will accellerate or decelerate over time, and the ball will decelerate due to air or ground friction. We also assume the ball doesn't move in a 3rd dimension (up and down) and that the speed is parallel to the ground. 

$$time_{player}= \frac{\parallel \bold{b} - \bold{p} \parallel}{s_{player}}$$  
$$time_{ball}= \frac{\parallel \bold{b} \parallel}{s_{ball}}$$

We will decompose the $\bold{b}$ vector into its component $x, y$ dimensions since we can leverage knowledge about the relationship between these components assuming a straight-line ball trajectory.

For the ball vector, $\bold{b}$, we know that the span of this vector falls on $y=mx$ since it starts at the origin.

$$\parallel \bold{b} \parallel = \sqrt{b_{x}^{2} + m^{2}b_{x}^{2}} = \sqrt{(m^{2}+1)b_{x}^{2}}$$
Where
$$m = \frac{b_{y}}{b_{x}}$$

And, decomposing $\bold{p}$ in the same way:

$$\parallel \bold{b} - \bold{p} \parallel = \sqrt{(b_{x} - p_{x})^{2} + (mb_{x}-p_{y})^{2}}$$
$$ = \sqrt{b_{x}^{2} - 2b_{x}p_{x} + p_{x}^2 + m^2b_{x}^{2} - 2mb_{2}p_{y} + p_{y}^2}$$
$$ = \sqrt{b_{x}^{2} + m^2b_{x}^{2} - 2b_{x}p_{x} - 2mb_{x}p_{y} + p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^2}$$
$$ = \sqrt{(m^2 + 1)b_{x}^{2} - 2(p_{x} + mp_{y})b_{x} + p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^2}$$

Now, substituting these into the full equation:

$$\frac{\sqrt{(m^{2}+1)b_{x}^{2}}}{s_{ball}} = \frac{\sqrt{(m^2 + 1)b_{x}^{2} - 2(p_{x} + mp_{y})b_{x} + p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^2}}{s_{player}} $$

Squaring both sides and rearranging, we get:

$$ (\frac{s_{player}}{s_{ball}})^2(m^{2} + 1)x^{2} =  (m^2 + 1)b_{x}^{2} - 2(p_{x} + mp_{y})b_{x} + p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^2$$

Giving the quadratic equation of the form $0 = ax^2 + bx + c$:

$$ 0 = (1 - (\frac{s_{player}}{s_{ball}})^2)(m^{2} + 1)x^{2} - 2(p_{x} + mp_{y})b_{x} + p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^2$$

where

$$ a = (1 - (\frac{s_{player}}{s_{ball}})^2)(m^{2} + 1)$$
$$ b = - 2(p_{x} + mp_{y})$$
$$ c = p_{x}^2 + p_{y}^2$$

which can be solved using the quadratic formula (np.roots in numpy).
